Abstract
	TxTy is a textable walkie-talkie. Sometimes you're out and about without service and you need to talk to 
	your buddy.
	
Challenges
-Software
	Data transmission - What kind of libraries exist for radio communication
	Security - Can the data transmission be secure or encrypted
	Transferring data in a readable format, is ASCII too much?
	Storing messages - Is an additional peripheral needed to store messages?
	Properly buffering data
	Keeping the MCU from wasting excessive power. The battery needs to last.
	Handling Data transmission errors
	
	
-Hardware
	Antenna - None of us are experts at wireless communication.
	Power Supply - We don't want to be plugged in, so we need batteries
	Screen - Different digital screens need different power levels and data transmission
	Keyboard - Small keyboards aren't readily available, but there are BlackBerry replacements
	MCU - Different models exist, one will work best for our project
	Interference - How badly are these modules affected by other wireless signals?
	
	
Proposed Methods
-Software
	There might be libraries already available for use with LoRa, or some other radio communication
		that would handle data transmission and encryption.
		
		
-Hardware
	Keyboard - BlackBerry replacements are readily available.
	Power Supply - Many PSUs are can be found for microcontrollers already.
	Screen - Many modules can be found for a reasonable price
	

Monetary Items:

Microcontroller: $5 - $20
Keyboard module: replacement blackberry keyboard? ~$25
Screen: ~$10-$20
Radio module: ~$10-$30
Batteries and chargers: $20?

Total per unit (worst case scenario): ~$100
Total per pair: $200

Collaboration Plan
-Communication method:
	Discord, there's a server. Maybe in person once we have hardware
	
-How are you going to resolve conflict?
	Emergency team meeting to get everyone on board and hear each other out.
	
-How are you going to keep good team momentum?
	A good schedule keeps people on track.

-How are you going to do when members fail progress?
	Assign a primary and secondary role to each position.

-How are you going to distribute budget?
	Colton can buy a good chunk of things... Divide up based on project?
